# Inexact Acquisition Function Optimization via Random Grid Search 

BO_UCB_GRID_ERROR_BAR.py contains Python code to reproduce the results in Section 5 of the manuscript. The current version of the code reproduces BO_UCB_GRID_CUM_REG_SMALL_INITIAL.png and BO_UCB_GRID_COMP_TIME_SMALL_INITIAL.png are simulation results with a smaller number of initial design points following the heuristics ($n = 5d$, note previously it was $n = 10d$) as well as a smaller number of iterations (so that the total number of function evaluations is ($T = 20d$).
