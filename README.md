# UCB_GRID

This repository includes updated plots for the 2025 UAI submission "Bayesian Optimization with Inexact Acquisition:
Is Random Grid Search Sufficient?"

> BO_UCB_GRID_UPDATED.png and BO_COMP_TIME_GRID_UPDATED now contain the updated figures of Figures 1 and 2 in the submitted manuscript.
> BO_MICHALEWICZ_CUM_REG.png and BO_MICHALEWICZ_COMP_TIME.png demonstrate the cumulative regret and computation time comparison of GP-UCB algorithms based on the following acquisition function solvers: uniform random grid search(Uniform), Nelder-Mead(NM), Conjugate Gradient Descent (CG), and L-BFGS-B on a 10-dimensional Michalewicz objective function.
> BO_UCB_GRID_automl_CUM_REG.pdf and BO_UCB_GRID_automl_COMP_TIME.pdf showcase the effectiveness of uniform random grid search as the acquisition function solver for an 11-dimensional machine learning model hyperparameter tuning problem.
