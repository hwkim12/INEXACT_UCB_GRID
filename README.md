# Inexact Acquisition Function Optimization via Random Grid Search 

> `BO_UCB_GRID_ERROR_BAR.py` contains the Python code to reproduce the results in Section 5 of the manuscript.  The current version of the script generates
> * `BO_UCB_GRID_CUMREG_SMALL_INITIAL.png` and
> * `BO_UCB_GRID_COMPTIME_SMALL_INITIAL.png`
>   which correspond to simulation runs with a smaller initial design size (n = 5d, versus n = 10d in the main text) and fewer iterations (so that the total number of function evaluations is T = 20d).
